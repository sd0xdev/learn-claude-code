LESSON 00: Welcome
═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

Hey, I'm Claude, and I'll be your guide through this course.

I'm an AI model that can read your code, answer questions, write tests, fix bugs, and help you build things faster. This course will teach you how to get the most out of it.

## Course commands

| Command            | What it does                 |
| ------------------ | ---------------------------- |
| `/course`          | Show the dashboard           |
| `/course next`     | Continue to your next lesson |
| `/course 05`       | Jump to a specific lesson    |
| `/course progress` | See detailed stats           |
| `/course exit`     | Pause and save your position |
| `/course update`   | Pull latest from GitHub      |

## Before we continue

When I make changes to your code, you'll see a diff:

```diff
- old code (being removed)
+ new code (being added)
```

You can **accept** or **reject** each change.

## Try it

When you're ready, type "next" to save your progress and continue to the first lesson.
